# Web_Design_Challenge
HTML/CSS HW for Bootcamp

## Data
* Initially I used the "stock" resource data that was supplied for the project. 
* However, after getting the project mostly completed, I realized that I could easily use my own data from the API Homework.
* I inserted my own pictures and my own "city" data to make this project truly my own.
